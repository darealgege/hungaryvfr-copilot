[TAG:ABOUT,H145][DESC: Our H145 helicopter has been rebuilt using the Asobo CFD helicopter flight model, with augmented controls to realistically simulate H145 systems. It features unstabilized flight, Stability Augmentation System (SAS) for stabilized flight, and fully hands-off Upper Modes like HDG/ALT/IAS. The H145 supports GPS-referenced modes, precision hands-off auto hover, and Force Trim (Trim Release), unique among MSFS helicopters. Additionally, it integrates a Garmin GTN750 for GPS approaches and more.];
[TAG:ABOUT,HOC,HYPE,OPERATION,CENTER][DESC: We use the Hype Operations Center for easy installation, quick updates, downgrades, and rollbacks of our products. The H145 offers over 600 key bindings through Hype Operations Center, and you can send events and monitor local variables using programs like SPAD.next or FSUIPC.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,HTAWS][DESC: Terrain Warning System, the Helicopter Terrain Awareness System (HTAWS) can be muted via the overhead AUDIO/TAWS switch to STBY or MUTE. Additionally, you can assign an HTAWS MUTE-FOR-5-MINS binding in Hype Operations Center, ideal for use before landing.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,AFCS][DESC: AFCS (Autoflight System), the H145 autopilot is a comprehensive system offering both basic stabilization and fully hands-off upper modes. It uses redundant Stability Augmentation Systems and aircraft management computers to process sensor data and command actuators. The system is monitored and controlled via MFDs, the Autopilot Control Panel (APCP), and controls on the cyclic and collective.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,TRIM,RELEASE][DESC: Trim Release (Cyclic Trim Release) is a button on the cyclic control that the pilot holds while manipulating the cyclic. This pauses the AFCS for maximum precision. There's also a Collective Trim Release, but it's less essential. Holding Trim Release is called Fly-Through Action.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,FOLLOW-UP,TRIM][DESC: Follow-Up Trim allows cyclic manipulation without using Trim Release, but requires a small H145 cyclic deadzone setting. Trim Release is still recommended. Follow-Up Trim works only in ATT mode (and submodes), updating attitude setpoints with any deflection. It has 4 settings: "Only Hover" is the realistic option, while "Off" is recommended for learning.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,AFCS OFF,A.TRIM OFF][DESC: AFCS OFF and A.TRIM OFF Operation, Pilots should fly with AFCS engaged during normal operations. Turn A.TRIM off for sloped landings or a heaving deck to prevent control inputs that could cause injury. AFCS and A.TRIM can be disengaged for training at the pilot's discretion.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,ATT/ATTITUDE HOLD][DESC: Attitude Hold Mode (ATT) is the default autopilot mode, providing long-term stabilization independently on all three axes. Also known as basic autopilot, it is not shown on the AFCS Status Strip. ATT engages automatically when at least one SAS is available and no other mode is selected, or when disengaging any upper mode. Change pitch and roll attitude using Cyclic Trim Release or Cyclic Beep Trim. Hold the new attitude for Fly-Through Action. Note: ATT mode turn coordination is inoperative.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,DSAS,DIGITAL,SAS][DESC: DSAS / Digital SAS, DSAS mode is a degraded sub-mode of ATT, engaged automatically on any axis when A.TRIM is inoperative. It provides short-term attitude stabilization but lacks long-term stabilization due to no auto trim. Engagement: Automatically due to trim failure or via A.TRIM Toggle. Reference Management: Change pitch and roll with Cyclic Trim Release or Cyclic Beep Trim, and trim yaw with Collective Beep Trim Left/Right. Hold the new attitude for Fly-Through Action.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,HDG,TRK][DESC: HDG and TRK Heading Hold Mode uses yaw below 30 knots and roll and yaw at higher speeds. Track Mode follows a GPS ground track, selectable via the APCP butterfly knob. Engagement: HDG Toggle on the APCP. Reference Management: Change heading with Cyclic Beep Trim Left/Right. Fly-Through Action: Return to selected heading.];

Engine 1 Main switch (latch), Engine 1 Ventilation Button (inoperative), Engine 1 FADEC Emergency switch (guard), OEI Training mode (inoperative)];
[TAG:ENGINE,MAIN,SWITCH][DESC: The Engine Main switch has three positions: OFF, IDLE, and FLIGHT. IDLE is for starting and cooldown without reaching 100% rotor RPM. FLIGHT is for takeoff and landing; it should be latched. OFF closes the fuel valve and shuts down the engine.];
[TAG:FADEC,EMER][DESC: The FADEC EMER switch activates a backup mode in case of a FADEC FAIL indication. It adjusts the fuel valve to match the working engine's TOT. Note: FADEC EMER will slow N1 changes, so avoid large power changes.];
[TAG:AUTOPILOT,CONTROL,PANEL][DESC:The Autopilot Control Panel (APCP) manages the autopilot systems, similar to a large airliner’s Mode Control Panel. Major systems are toggled on/off with top-row buttons, with OFF indicating the system may be off or inoperative due to failure or power loss. A.TRIM (AUTO TRIM) manages cyclic trim and feedback, allowing hands-off flight with interventions via CYCLIC TRIM RELEASE or manual adjustment. BKUP (BACKUP SAS) provides basic 3-axis stabilization, used only if AP1 and AP2 fail. AP1 and AP2 are redundant autopilot systems in the aircraft management computers, offering basic stabilization and upper modes like HDG, NAV, and ALT. One system acts as primary and the other as standby, requiring AVIONICS (AVIO 1 or AVIO 2) to be ON.];
[TAG:AUTOPILOT,UPPER,MODES][DESC: Each upper modes knob toggles the mode with a push function and adjusts the bug or setpoint with left/right turns. The VS/HDG butterfly knob switches between traditional (HDG, VS) and GPS (TRK, FPA) modes. In GPS mode, VS becomes FPA and HDG becomes TRK. Collective modes (CRHT, IAS, ALT.A, VS/FPA) use the collective control. Engagement will lock the collective axis unless you hold COLLECTIVE TRIM RELEASE.];
[TAG:AUTOPILOT,COLLECTIVE,MODES][DESC: CRHT (Cruise Height) uses the radio altimeter to maintain altitude, ideal for hilly terrain and over water, but results in a rough ride. IAS (Indicated Airspeed) functions like airspeed hold in fixed-wing aircraft. ALT.A (Altitude Acquire) allows preselection of a new altitude. The aircraft remains in the current mode, then switches to VS mode to reach the new altitude. ALT mode will engage automatically once the new altitude is reached. VS/FPA (Vertical Speed/Flight-Path-Angle) functions like vertical speed hold in fixed-wing aircraft, with FPA allowing a descent angle based on speed. Useful with FPV on the SVS view. ALT (Altitude Hold) maintains barometric altitude, with setpoint changes only possible via COLLECTIVE BEEP TRIM or switching to ALT.A mode.];
[TAG:AUTOPILOT,ROLL/YAW,MODES][DESC: Roll /Yaw mode HDG/TRK (Heading/Track Hold) functions like fixed-wing heading hold, using roll at higher speeds and yaw under 30 knots. Track mode adjusts heading to maintain a straight line despite crosswind.];
[TAG:AUTOPILOT,NON-APCP,MODES][DESC: NAV (including APP and V.APP) is engaged by selecting a navigation source on the MFD (NAV softkey) and coupling it with the CPL softkey. GTC (Ground Trajectory Command) is engaged by pressing the AP/GTC binding or using the Tablet autopilot panel. GTC.H (Ground Trajectory Command in Hover) is engaged by double-clicking the AP/GTC binding or using the Tablet autopilot panel. ATT mode engages automatically if no upper mode is active. GA (Go-Around) is engaged by pressing the COLLECTIVE GA control.];
[TAG:AUTOPILOT,BEEP TRIM][DESC: When autopilot modes are active, context-sensitive "beep trim" controls are available. Assign these to a hat or use the Tablet autopilot panel. These controls adjust the relevant bug based on the active mode, such as altitude in ALT mode or vertical speed in VS mode.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,HELIONIX,AVIONICS][DESC: The Helionix system includes three identical MFDs, two aircraft management computers, and various sensors and hardware.];

[TAG:SYSTEM,FLI][DESC: First Limit Indicator (FLI). The FLI on the FND page shows the combined power-plant limits: Engine/MGB torque (TRQ), Engine N1 compressor speed (N1), and Engine turbine output temperature (TOT). The FLI tape's background reflects the collective position from 0 to 10 degrees pitch. Exceeding these limits can cause the NR to drop (if N1 is exceeded) and excessive torque can damage the engine and MGB. The FADEC will not exceed N1 or TOT limits, except in case of failure.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,FLI,AEO,ALL ENGINES OPERATIVE][DESC: When all engines are operative, the FLI shows power limits, mainly based on torque. Pilots should avoid exceeding the transient power limit; using the range between the maximum and transient power limits is allowed only for up to 2 seconds unintentionally. The blue line shows the power available if an engine fails. If the collective is above this line during a failure, the pilot must lower it to prevent rotor RPM decay. The takeoff power limit is available for 30 minutes, after which the power should be reduced to maximum continuous power. A power rating timer appears 90 seconds before the 30 minutes elapse.];
[TAG:SYSTEM,FLI,OEI,ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE][DESC: The FLI indicates the OEI status and power limits. The pilot can switch between the 30-second and 2-minute OEI power bands using the OEI HI/LO button. If the collective position exceeds the engine's capability, the rotor RPM will drop.];
