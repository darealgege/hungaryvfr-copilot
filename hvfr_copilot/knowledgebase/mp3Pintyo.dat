[TAG:DISCORD,BOT,FEATURES][DESC: The bot is designed for flight simulation, offering numerous commands related to aviation and simulators. To list the commands, use the </commands> command. The bot features various AI functions and actively interacts with users. The AI knowledge base is server-specific, allowing each server to have its own unique database. The bot plays an active role in user support, answering questions based on its knowledge base about the server or product topics. Since the bot focused on simulators, you can use the </manuals> command to search AI-powered, aircraft-specific manuals and get answers to questions about specific aircraft types. You can also use the AI for image generation (its use more than 15 image generation models) or just for casual chatting. Some of the bot's commands are also available to use everywhere on Discord, like </manuals>, </chatgpt>. By adding the bot to your account, you can use it on all of the servers, DMs, and group chats as the bot not required to be added to the server. You can translate a message into different languages by reacting with the corresponding country flag emoji (e.g., ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ for English, ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª for German). Over 50 languages are supported. Use the </translate-to> Translate a message to a selected language and send it to the Discord channel. Use the </translate-channel list> command to list the server's channel language restrictions. Server admins can restrict specific channels to a given language, and messages written in other languages will automatically be translated into the designated language. The bot also offers various notification services, including monitoring YouTube channels and notifying about new videos. This can be customized per server for different YouTube channels. It also tracks and notifies about IVAO and VATSIM ATC changes. Users can link their Discord accounts with their VATSIM profiles. The bot will then synchronize the profile and assign the appropriate Discord VATSIM role on supported Discord servers. The bot provides real-time data from the </ivao>, </vatsim>, and </newsky> networks, including active flights and controllers. On servers that enable this service, you can use the </vatsim-connect> command to activate automatic synchronization of your Discord profile with your VATSIM rating. This will automatically grant you the appropriate VATSIM Discord role on the server. Use the </calculator calculator> command for an aviation-related calculator and unit converter.];
