[TAG:DISCORD,BOT,FEATURES][DESC: The bot is designed for flight simulation, offering numerous commands related to aviation and simulators. To list the commands, use the </commands> command. The bot features various AI functions and actively interacts with users. The AI knowledge base is server-specific, allowing each server to have its own unique database. The bot plays an active role in user support, answering questions based on its knowledge base about the server or product topics. Since the bot focused on simulators, you can use the </manuals> command to search AI-powered, aircraft-specific manuals and get answers to questions about specific aircraft types. You can also use the AI for image generation (its use more than 15 image generation models) or just for casual chatting. Some of the bot's commands are also available to use everywhere on Discord, like </manuals>, </chatgpt>. By adding the bot to your account, you can use it on all of the servers, DMs, and group chats as the bot not required to be added to the server. You can translate a message into different languages by reacting with the corresponding country flag emoji (e.g., üá¨üáß for English, üá©üá™ for German). Over 50 languages are supported. Use the </translate-to> Translate a message to a selected language and send it to the Discord channel. Use the </translate-channel list> command to list the server's channel language restrictions. Server admins can restrict specific channels to a given language, and messages written in other languages will automatically be translated into the designated language. The bot also offers various notification services, including monitoring YouTube channels and notifying about new videos. This can be customized per server for different YouTube channels. It also tracks and notifies about IVAO and VATSIM ATC changes. Users can link their Discord accounts with their VATSIM profiles. The bot will then synchronize the profile and assign the appropriate Discord VATSIM role on supported Discord servers. The bot provides real-time data from the </ivao>, </vatsim>, and </newsky> networks, including active flights and controllers. On servers that enable this service, you can use the </vatsim-connect> command to activate automatic synchronization of your Discord profile with your VATSIM rating. This will automatically grant you the appropriate VATSIM Discord role on the server. Use the </calculator calculator> command for an aviation-related calculator and unit converter.];

[TAG:BLADETYPES,BLADE,TYPES][DESC:Drop-Point Blade: The drop-point, a common blade shape, has a convex spine curving down to the point, providing an easily controlled point and a large belly for slicing. It‚Äôs versatile and perfect for hunters. - Sheepsfoot Blade: Sheepsfoot blades, with a straight edge and curved spine meeting at the point, are designed for slicing and minimizing accidental piercing. Originally used for trimming sheep‚Äôs hooves, they are now useful as rescue tools. - Wharncliffe Blade: Wharncliffe Blade is similar to a sheepsfoot blade, this shape has a straight edge and a gradually curved spine from handle to tip. It‚Äôs ideal for slicing and minimizing accidental punctures, and is useful in similar situations. - Clip-Point Blade: The clip point, a common blade shape, has a spine with a clipped front section, creating a fine point ideal for precision tasks. - Normal Blade/Straight Back Blade: Normal Blade has a straight spine and a curved edge meeting at the tip. Its long spine adds weight and sturdiness for chopping and slicing, with added force possible by applying hand pressure to the unsharpened area. - Tanto Blade: Tanto Blade inspired by samurai short swords, this blade shape has an angular edge transition for a stronger point, good for piercing tough objects but less adept at slicing. - Gut Hook: A gut hook, more of a blade feature, is a small, sharpened curve on the spine for field dressing game without damaging underlying parts. A spey point blade has a flat edge and spine that curve near the tip, creating a short belly and broad tip to prevent accidental piercing. Originally used for neutering farm animals, they‚Äôre now common on trapper blades and favored by hunters. - Trailing-Point Blade: A trailing point blade has an upward curving spine, creating an elevated point and oversized belly, making it good for slicing, skinning, and filleting. - Fejesg√∂rbe: The term ‚Äúfejesg√∂rbe‚Äù refers to a type of knife that has been known and popular for a long time. The characteristic of the "fejesg√∂rbe" knife is that it retains the external features typical of traditional folding knives, but changes the locking mechanism to make it quick and easy to use. The handle is gracefully curved and widens significantly at the first bolster. This allows it to perfectly hide the blade when it is closed.];
