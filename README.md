# HungaryVFR CoPilot WebUI Chat Application

## Overview

The HungaryVFR CoPilot WebUI Chat Application is a web-based, general-purpose chatbot powered by the OpenAI API. It allows users to engage in conversations with an AI assistant on a wide range of topics. The application supports custom knowledge bases in its own format, enabling users to enhance the AI's responses with specialized information. 
Knowledge base examples are included to help you get started.

Designed for flexibility and adaptability, this chatbot can be tailored to various use cases, from casual conversation to domain-specific assistance. Whether you want to use it for general inquiries, educational purposes, or integrate your own data, the HungaryVFR CoPilot WebUI Chat Application provides a robust platform for interactive AI experiences.

The application is designed with modularity in mind, allowing certain functions to be easily integrated into existing websites. This means you can customize and embed the chatbot into your own site, tailoring it to specific needs. For example, if you have a website focused on a particular product, you can set up the chatbot to use your own pre-defined AI profile and knowledge base, providing users with specialized assistance related to your product.

This project is a web-based counterpart to the HungaryVFR CoPilot Discord bot, sharing the same knowledge base but functioning independently. While it provides details on Discord commands, it does not execute them.
